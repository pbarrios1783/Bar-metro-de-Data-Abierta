"For instance, Jinan City Big Data Bureau organized a data training program with Shandong University targeting public servants within the bureau but also targetting public servants who has data skill in other departments (2). The other example is from Zhejiang University who was commissioned by Shanxi Province Government to deliver training for 52 youth public servants from different level across government departments. (3) In addtion to above two types of training designed for a general purpose on understanding big data and how data might be used in theory ing overnance,  there are also training targeting specific group on specific topic.

",
There might also be quite technical training designed for public servants.

For the most part, government initiatives to train civil servants on data matters are laid down in NL DIGITAL: Data Agenda Government. The objective of this agenda is to promote the sharing, combining and analysis of data through cooperation between governments. The element consists of five elements, the last two of which are relevant here: 4. Collecting and sharing knowledge on working data-driven,  and 5. Investing in people, organisations and culture change'. (1) As part of number 4, the Learning and Expertise Center Data-driven working (LED) was set up. Here, best practices, methods and techniques and knowledge about data-driven working are collected and shared. (2) For example, they created the Data Governance Self-assessment tool, consisting of 43 questions on 8 themes, determining the position and ambition of a government organisation when it comes to data governance. Also, in 2020 LED launched the 'Toolkit Data-driven Working', with methods, techniques, prerequisites, best practices, case studies, interviews, tips from experts, information on ethical and legal aspects, et cetera. (3) Another example included in the Data Agenda Government, is the Den Bosch Data Week that the Ministry of Interior Affairs supports. This week is about showing government organisations and other target audiences what the social value of data can be. (4) Also, different knowledge conferences are organised by different government organisations. (5) ",
,
"Element 5 of the Data Agenda focuses on recruiting new talent, education, training and development of civil servants, setting up an infrastructure of datalabs and data science workspaces, promoting better data management, and changing the way of working within government organisations. For instance, government organisations are being encouraged to hire a Chief Data Officer and develop a data strategy, like more and more public bodies are doing. The Directorate CIO State is developing a blueprint for the role of Chief Data Officers. (6) Furthermore in 2019 the National Academy for Digitalisation and Computerisation in Government (RADIO) has launched an e-learning module on the impact and opportunities of digitisation for policy staff. They also organise different seminars, webinars, podcasts, e-learnings, access to Digi-Coaches, LinkedIn-groups, and courses to teach civil servants about data, cyber security, AI, digital skills, et cetera. (7) Also, in 2019 the government, together with the Technical University of Delft, started the Digicampus, where scientists, government bodies, businesses and citizens work together on digital government innovations to improve public service, including through use of data. (8) Furthermore, the Ministry of Interior Affairs and the Association of the Netherlands Municipalities, are developing international framework guidelines for responsible data use, through the working group 'Data Driven Public Sector' of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is chaired by the Netherlands. (9) For more examples, see the NL DIGITAL: Data Agenda Government (file attached). ",
,
"Additionally, there's the Learning and Expertise Point Open Government, which is focussed on sharing knowledge and experiences when it comes to open data. They offer tools and instruments and bring civil servants in contact with experts. For example, through the project 'Breakthrough with Open Data', open data relays were organised, where NGOs, governments and other stakeholders came together to solve social issues with data. Furthermore, they offer an Open Data Toolkit, with i.e. a roadmap and practical tips to get started with open data. (10) ",
,
"Lastly, the national data platform, Data.government.nl, offers open data knowledge and technical support. For example through the Open Data Guide, that civil servants can use to achieve open data within their organisation. (11) ",

The Academy of Civil Service was defined as the principal institution to perform this task; the institution's activities in this strand are supported by the UNDP and EU that provide capacity-building technical assistance. In May 2019, Turkmenistan's public servants of all levels were ordered to undergo short training in the """"basics of the digital economy"""" (1). In March 2020, the Academy launched a pilot program on Digital Management for 20 participants (2), and in 2021, it awarded the master's degree in Digital Management to the first group of graduates (3). The Academy's Master's program in Public Administration also contains a module on e-governance. Separately, OSCE and USAID also conduct short training courses on using information and communication technologies in public administration for public servants (4, 5). Despite these positive developments, the overall progress has been minimal and slow thus far. The training initiatives remain mostly short-term and isolated and involve a handful of national-level public servants. The lack of detailed and reliable information about the quality of state-sponsored training programs and their positive impact is another noticeable shortcoming. ",

",
,
"In addition to the """"Personal Information Protection Law"""", the framework on personal information protection has been dramatically developed in recent years especially during the period from 2016 to 2021. The """"CyberSecurity law""""  effective in 2017 (2), """"Information Security Technology — Personal Information Security Specification""""(3) effective in 2020 and  """"Civil Code"""" (4) effective in 2021 as well as other fragmented sector-specific or issue-specific regulations, guidelines and specifications all together already make a robust and strong framework for personal information protection. The Cybersecurity Law sets out the legal principles and high-level requirements on protection of personal data collected and / or processed via the networks operators.  And the Article 111 of the Civil Code sets out the basic principle that natural person's personal data shall be protected by law; any organization and individuals must collect personal data after obtaining the personal data subject's consent and conduct the collection according to the law; they shall ensure the security of the personal data collected; illegal collection, using, processing and transmitting of others' personal data, illegal transaction of selling / purchasing personal data, and illegal provision / disclosure of personal data shall be prohibited.",
,
Key elements of Personal Information Protection are discussed below:,
,
"- Choice and consent: The Civil Code Chapter 6 """"Privacy and Personal Information Protection"""" layouts the general foundation and guidelines for personal information processing stating that first an individual must be well informed of the purposes and procedures of processing personal information and second an explicit consent must be obtained to legally process personal information . The Cybersecurity law (Article 41) and the draft of Personal Information Protection Law (Article 13) also provides similar statements. The Article 17 of the drafted Personal Information Protection Law also empowers the individual to access to service even without giving any consent to process personal information whenever it's possible.",
,
"Above frameworks also layouts exceptions for consent if allowed by relevant laws and regulations : for instance under the condition of a national security or public health emergency case, or  news report that is relevant to public interest.",
- Access and correction: The Civil Code Article 1037 empowers people the right to access and copy own personal information and has the right to correct and ask to delete information. The draft of Personal Information Protection Law specifies the data subject's right to access and correct own information. The article 44-45 grants the data subject's the right to know what information is held by the data handler and has the right to access. The article 46-47 empowers the data subject to correct and even delete relevant personal information. ,
- Responsibilities on data holders:,
[a] taking steps to ensure personal information is updated and accurate; ,
The Article 8 of the draft Personal Information Protection Law states a general principle for personal information processing that high data quality is required so data should be accurate and up-to-date to avoid any possible negative impact on personal rights. ,
[b] limiting access to personal data in accordance with its intended use; ,
The Article 14 of the draft Personal Information Protection Law requires that the data holder must re-obtain consent if the purpose of collecting and using personal information has been changed. Article 22 further requires that the data holder should be responsible for limiting the data access and use if the third party is contracted to process personal information.,
[c] only transferring data to third-parties if there are assurances they will also respect data protection rights,
"Article 23-24 requires that if transferring data to third-parties is necessary then the transfer should be agreed with the data subject and the third parties should process data under the original agreed purpose. If it is necessary to change the purpose of use, then new consent must be obtained. ",
[d] destroying or anonymising data after it is no longer needed for its original intended use.,
Article 47 of draft Personal Information Protection Law  requires that data holder should proactively delete personal information if it is no longer needed for its original intended use.,
- Rights of redress:,
"The Article 68 and 69 of draft Personal Information Protection Law empowers individual to ask compensation if personal informoation processing leads to any negative impact on the individual. In the case of multiple individuals or a collective are affected,  then relevant agency or authority has the right to sue the data holder on behalf of the group of individuals. ",
The independent oversight however is only limited to the designated authority while there is no specific Articles encourage civic society orgnaization to provide independent oversight. ,
- Breach notification:,
"The Article 56 of draft Personal Information Protection Law requires that data holder should report the breach immediately to the individual and relevant agency and explain what information are breached and possible negative impact and consequences, why and how the information are breached, what has been done to minimize the negative impact and what actions are suggested to the impacted individuals.",
"The similar requirements were also covered by the Article 42 of Cybersecurity law, the section 10.2 of Personal Information Security Specification and Article 1038 of Civil Code.",
- Location data:,
The location-related data is covered in the definition of what is personal information. The Civil law defined personal information includes personal location history information. ,
- Algorithmic decision-making:,
The Article 55 of draft Personal Information Protection Law  requires that data holders should conduct risk assessment  before employing any algorithmic decision making and keep assessment records for at least three years. ,
"The Article 25 of draft Personal Information Protection Law requires the transparency and fairness of decision made by algorithmic system. It further empowers individuals to receive alternative decisions not based upon personal information,  seek explanation and refuse any decisions solely made by algorithmic system. ",

Guatemala also does not have a regulatory authority that is responsible for controlling the use of personal data, its transfer, processing, commercialisation, and in general terms, its protection. In addition, attempts to issue specific regulation have failed. But there are alternative norms or laws that play a partial role in protection of personal data.",
,
"The Political Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala ('the Constitution') recognises privacy and data privacy rights as a constitutional right. (1) Articles one to five of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala implicitly recognises the right to human dignity and human rights that encompass a right to privacy. Article 23 of the Constitution also recognises dignity and the right to privacy in establishing the inviolability of housing, and Article 24 of the Constitution recognises the inviolability of every individual's correspondence, documents, and book-keeping, and provides that the privacy of correspondence by telephone, radio, cable, and other modes of modern digital technology is guaranteed. Furthermore, Article 30 of the Constitution establishes the public nature of administrative acts and recognises that individuals have the right to obtain public information from the administration. Article 31 of the Constitution determines that any individual has the right to know about all private and personal information recorded in public registries, and has the right to know about the purpose for which such information is recorded, as well as having the right to correct, rectify, and update such information. ",
,
"Decree No. 57-2008 on the Law on Access to Public Information ('the Law on Access to Public Information'), introduces key data protection concepts such as personal data and sensitive personal data (2). Nevertheless, the subject matter of this law is to secure the access to public information that is in possession of public authorities and obligated entities under the Law on Access to Public Information. The article 64 of the Law on Access to Public Information regulates the commercialisation of personal data and imposes sanctions (fines and imprisonment) to those that distribute, by any means, files containing personal data or sensitive personal data, which do not come from public registries, without the written consent of the data subject. ",
,
"In a decision issued by the Constitutional Court, Case No. 3552-2014 of 10 February 2015 ('Case 3552-2014'), where the Ombudsman of Human Rights ('the Ombudsman') had filed a case against various private entities accused of gathering and commercialising private information from individuals without their consent. (3) Case 1356-2006 was emblematic in the sense that it was the first case in which the Constitutional Court decided to afford data privacy protection despite the absence of a law regulating this matter in detail. In particular, the Constitutional Court outlined, 'Once a person's right to determine the existence or nonexistence of registries or databases containing his/her personal data is recognised, as well as their right to obtain the rectification, deletion or blocking thereto if the incorrect use of the data may affect his/her intimacy and honour, the manner in which the judicial protection of such rights can be requested must be determined. It is known that in comparative law and in accordance with procedural constitutional modern doctrine, the protection of such rights is done through the action of 'habeas data', which has not been regulated in Guatemala. This case is important and of great relevance because it introduced the right to privacy in Guatemala in the absence of specific data protection legislation.",
,
"In the absence of such a law, and while such a situation prevails in the country, this court holds that given the nature and ample scope of the constitutional remedy of legal actions such as 'amparo', amparo is the appropriate constitutional action destined to guarantee the right of every person to access their personal data kept in private or official databases or registries.'",

These laws neither  cover data protection matters   exclusively nor in sufficient detail. The laws touch on consent when  it comes to processing of  personal  data and provide redresses against public institutions that   breach data protection laws. However the laws do not specifically give any provisions addressing algorithmic decision making or cover the protection of location related data.",
These absence of such provisions in the current framework indicate that   there is a need for a robust stand alone act solely for data protection especially considering that a lot of personal date is now being collected by a number of public  and private bodies without the necessary safeguards.,
,
"There is a  draft   data protection Bill which , once enacted, will empower section 21 of the Malawian constitution which has remained largely inoperative due to the lack of a specific law that details its framework for enforcement. In turn, this will help the government to fulfil its obligation on the protection of rights to privacy (3). However, certain limitations have been pointed out. While Clause 5 exempts processing of personal data, if done by individuals """"solely for personal, recreational or household purposes from the application of the law,"""" (4) it does not define the terms """"personal,"""" """"recreational"""" or """"household"""" purposes - this leaves room for abuse of privacy of the data subject. And Clause 14 provides for a penalty in case of breach of confidentiality of a fine of K5,000,000 (USD 6,289) and imprisonment for five years  - an express double punishment that may lead to miscarriage of justice (5).

The combination of both apply to all the levels and branches of government. I would say the protection of personal data is extensive, as the relevant regulatory framework does not only promote the protection of the data and has been implemented in practice, but it complies with quality requirements such as providing the right of choice / consent of the people, the right to access and / or correct personal data, imposes clear responsibilities on those who guard the information (differentiating between the figuv  vc res of """"charged with"""" and """"responsible"""" for the data), and provides the right to redress against public and private bodies that violate data privacy.",

"In fact, the right to the protection of personal data is only limited by exception provided in the aforementioned laws and is stipulated in the Political Constitution of the Mexican United States (3), in its article 16 as a fundamental right or individual guarantee that cannot be waived. Therefore, sanction mechanisms are provided for the infringement of personal data, ranging from warnings, to economic, civil and even criminal sanctions.",
,
"The autonomous body for the protection of personal data is the National Institute of Transparency, Access to Information and Protection of Personal Data (4), and constantly issues consultation material to facilitate understanding of the concept of personal data, disclose best practices on privacy and confidentiality notices and what to do if you consider a potential vulnerability of this right. These materials exist for both the private and public sectors and range from the best Guides of self-regulation schemes in the field of personal data protection to suggested minimum criteria for contracting computing services in the cloud that involve the processing of personal data.",

The GDPR applies to the processing of all personal data (Article 2). The definitions of data 'controllers' and 'processors' cover all private and public sectors. (1) ",
,
"Chapter 6 of the GDPR dictates that each member state should have an independent supervisory authority ensuring and monitoring the application of the regulation, 'in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union' (Article 51, 52). Among other things, this authority monitors data protection, advises legislative and administrative government bodies, and handles complaints lodged by data subjects, organizations or others (Article 57(1.f)(2)). The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) is called the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens. The mentioned fundamental rights are Article 8 European Convention on Human Rights and Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental rights. (2)",
,
"Data processors (when they are a public body, or when processing data is their main activity or they do it on a large scale) need to appoint a data protection officer, who registers with and reports to the national authority, and is responsible for GDPR-compliance. This is implemented thorugh the GDPRIA. (3) Furthermore, Article 68 of the GDPR established the European Data Protection Board, which is composed of the heads of the supervisory authority of member states. It is responsible for the consistent application of the DDPR. It's tasks consist of monitoring, advising the EU Commission, and issuing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for data processors, governments and supervisory authorities (Article 70 GDPR). Also it issues opinions when national authorities take certain measures and settles disputes between or within national authorities (Articles 64 & 65). (4)",
,
Article 77 of the GDPR gives data subjects the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and Article 78 contains the right to an effective judicial remedy against this supervisory authority. Article 79 adds a right to an effective judicial remedy against a data controller or processor. Together these articles ensure an effective right to redress. (5) ,
,
"Data controllers have to comply with the core principles and responsibilities set out in article 5 GDPR. I.a. taking steps to ensure personal information is updated and accurate; limiting access to personal data in accordance with its intended use; only transferring data to third-parties if there are assurances they will also respect data protection rights; destroying or anonymising data after it is no longer needed for its original intended use. The Controller is responsible for ensuring third parties comply to the principles as well (Article 5 Paragraph 2, and Article 4, Paragraph 1). Rules related to  transferring of data are set out in Chapter 5. (6) ",
,
"Data controllers and processors must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to existing security  risks (Article 32 GDPR). The GDPR requires a personal data breach to be notified, without undue delay (max. 72 hours) by the controller to its supervisory authority, and for more serious breaches to be notified to the affected data subjects as well (Article 33 & 34). Article 4 defines a data breach as a 'breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed'. (7) ",
,
"The framework contains specific rules covering algorithmic decision-making. To 'ensure fair and transparent processing', the controller has to provide a data subject with (access to) information on the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject (Article 13(2.f), 14(2.g) and 15(1.h) GDPR). Article 22 GDPR formulates a prohibition on fully automated individual decision-making that is based on profiling, if it has a legal or otherwise significant impact on the data subject. (8) According to the Dutch DPA, this means: 'important decisions should not be made by an algorithm alone, without human intervention'. (9) However, Article 22 provides three exceptions. Automated decision making is allowed when it is: necessary for entering into or performing a contract, authorized by EU or Member State law, or the data subject has given their explicit (opt-in) consent. When decisions are taken on the basis of the first and second option, the data subject also has the right to obtain human intervention, to contest the decision, and to express his or her point of view. The Dutch DPA has used the second option to implement exceptions to the prohibition in Article 40 of the GDPRIA, which states that the GDPR does not apply if the automated individual decision-making, other than based on profiling, is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. (10) So for instance when awarding study or child allowances. (11)",
,
"The GDPR does not contain specific rules on location data, but it does consider this to be personal information, so as long as it is not anonymized is falls under the protection of the regulation. The ePrivacy Directive (Directive (EU) 2002/58/EC), which will soon be replaced by the e-privacy directive, handles data protection in the context of telecommunication, so it protects location data related to users' terminal equipment. (12) Also, the European Data Protection Board that oversees the GDPR implementation, on the 21ste of April 2021, issued guidelines (on the basis of Article 70(1.e) GDPR), for the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It has developed rules on the data, the purpose of use, security, et cetera. However, the guidelines are not binding. (13) ",
,
"No other additions or changes to the legal framework have been made. However, in March 2020 the Dutch DPA announced it would be making some adjustments to its approach, in light of Covid-19. They wrote that the DPA is """"giving governments and companies room to focus on combating corona during the corona crisis. For example, organizations will be given more time to respond to questions from the AP where necessary, and the DPA will give initiatives to protect public health plenty of room. But the regulator will continue to intervene where privacy is truly at risk."""" For example, they allow some  health care facillities that do not have a way to make secure video calls to patient, to use consumer apps like FaceTime or Skype. (14) ",

It """"affords New Zealanders better privacy protections, and organisations and businesses greater obligations when handling personal information"""" and """"gives the Privacy Commissioner greater powers to ensure organisations and businesses comply with the Act"""".(2) It sets out twelve privacy  information principles covering rights of choice or consent, rights to access and correct personal data, rights of redress and notification of data breaches and responsibilities for data holders(3). It also gives the Privacy Commissioner the power to issue codes of practice that become part of the law. These codes modify the operation of the Privacy Act and set rules for specific industries, organisations, or types of personal information(4).",
"Complaints, investigations, and proceedings are set out in Part 5 (5). The Privacy Act does not cover location-related data, other than allowing law enforcement authorities to reveal location for vehicles of interest, missing persons (for fines enforcement), and records of prisoners(6). Privacy, ethics and human rights are safeguarded in the government's voluntary Algorithm Charter for Aotearoa New Zealand to which 26 government agencies have signed up(7). This Charter complements the 2018 Principles for the safe and effective use of data and analytics(8). No impact assessment of the Charter has been completed in this survey period. The Privacy Commissioner has published a very extensive range of publications describing the Privacy Act 2020(9). On 6 July 2021 the Government announced it would implement a new legislative framework for a consumer data right following public consultation on a 2020 Discussion Paper(10), (11). New Zealand Geospatial Research and Development Priorities and Opportunities 2016 – 2020 states that obstacles to increasing the uptake and use of geospatial information include concerns about data privacy, data ownership, the liability for the use of data and data confidentiality(12).",

"To date, when a person completes any contracts or documents, for example, at a university, a hospital (including commercial laboratories), a government agency, etc., the """"Consent to the Processing of Personal Data"""" form is additionally issued and must be completed. It is also filled in electronically, for example, when a person registers on the site, fills out a form, or draws up a ticket for the event. ",
,
"Since July 1, 2017, legislation in the field of personal data has been significantly tightened. Tightening affected the owners of sites and agencies, their developing and servicing. The minimal (incomplete) list of actions [2] of site owners in order to avoid fines and blocking consists of the following items:",
,
"1. Under each form of data entry on sites and mobile applications (registration form, application, feedback, etc.), place the text """"By clicking on the button, I consent to the processing of personal data"""", where the text """"consent to the processing of personal data """"is a link to the document itself. Instead of consent, you can use a single public offer, but it will need to register for what purposes, what data is being processed. In this case, it is necessary to store logs to prove to the authorized body that a particular user actually visited the site and left his personal data there.",
"2. The site owner must approve the Policy on the processing of personal data by the order and place it in his office, on the site, and in the mobile application in the public domain.",
3. Transfer the site to the territory of the Russian Federation and learn from the technical support of the hosting provider or data center the address of the location of your server (find out right up to the building).,
"4. Specify an email where an individual can apply to ensure that his personal data is deleted, blocked and where he can ask a question about personal data.",
"5. The Agency and the site owner must submit a notice on the processing of personal data to the authorized body and, among other things, specify the addresses of the location of the personal data bases and the list of personal data contained therein.",
"6. The Agency and the site owner, in case the agency has access to personal data from applications, databases or simply attracts customers, it is necessary to conclude an agreement on the security of personal data, which will indicate which personal data can be processed, for what purposes and what actions with them can be performed.",
,
The legal requirement for the processing of personal data on servers located on the territory of Russia led to the blocking of the Linkedin and Slideshare in Russia [3].,
,
"Despite the rather rigid and detailed legislation on personal data in Russia, there have been cases of leakage of the personal data of citizens. For example, in the summer of 2017, one of the users announced, that 17.7 thousand people were leaked from the Pension Fund of Russia in Moscow and the Moscow Region [4]. He received an e-mail from the pension fund, which contained a file with a table in which the user had to find a line with his name using the search and enter data. According to him, the employees of the pension fund did not consider that the filter of the Excel table allows to show all the lines.",
,
"In 2016, Infowatch (a company that deals with data security analytics) recorded that 128 million sensitive data records were compromised in Russia [5].",
,
"In addition, in accordance with Article 24 of the Russian Constitution, the collection, storage, use, and dissemination of information on a person's private life without his consent is not allowed. Bodies of state power and local self-government bodies, their officials are obliged to provide everyone with an opportunity to get acquainted with documents and materials directly affecting his rights and freedoms, unless otherwise provided by law.",

It does have certain positive features, such as obligations imposed on the data holders concerning data security, its depersonalization in certain circumstances, and its destruction upon request of the data subject (1). Nonetheless, the framework implements the simplified approach suggested by the GDPR (2) and has noticeable gaps. The Law, for instance, does not require registration of a personal data database and notification of data subject to the data breach and does not envisage the appointment of a data protection officer. The framework also vaguely defines the exceptional cases when the consent of data subjects can be overridden in the name of protecting national security and constitutional rights and freedoms of the data subjects and other individuals, laying the groundwork for the potential abuse of office by security services and other state institutions. The protection of personal data is undermined further by the poor enforcement and lack of independent institutions safeguarding citizens from arbitrary and disproportionate interference (3), which is reflected in the country's poor human rights record (4).

The Constitution of Uganda 1995, Article 27, Section 2 provides the grounding for the protection of personal data by prohibiting interference with the privacy of a person's home, correspondence, communication or other property (1). This provision was operationalized by The Data Protection and Privacy Act passed in February of 2019 and which provides a comprehensive framework for the protection of the individual the privacy and of personal data (2). This was followed by the development of the Data Protection and Privacy Regulations and approved in 2021 (3). There are cases of the Government of Uganda enforcing these legal frameworks. For example, Unwanted Witness petitioned the Speaker of Parliament against the SafeBoda app highlighting their failures to comply with data protection law that lead to the National Information Technology Authority Uganda (NITA-U) taking enforcement action of requesting the entity to make fundamental changes to how they handle people's personal data in particular in their information notices and data sharing practices (4). There are reports on how COVID-19 surveillance in Uganda is reducing people's data protection rights. For example, the Guidelines on COVID-19 Self Quarantine require individuals to provide their name, next of kin, physical address and telephone contact and permit the government surveillance teams to monitor individuals for 14 days (5). The Data Protection and Privacy Act 2019 is silent about budget allocations for implementation of this legal framework but it is important to note that it falls within the mandate of NITA-U. Lastly, the government of Uganda recently appointed the National Director of Personal Data Protection Office, an independent office under the National Information Technology Authority-Uganda (NITA-U)(6).",

The European Commission ignored the resolution and agreed to give the UK an """"adequacy decision"""" that enables cross border data flows more or less as if the UK was still in the EU.[7]",

The Act also provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amendment of their records, and sets forth various agency record-keeping requirements. In addition to the Privacy Act, there is a range of data protection regulations for specific datasets collected by the Federal Government which can be observed in the Federal Privacy Council's Law Library. (2) For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulates personal health information and sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures. In reaction to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Federal Government waived all provisions of the HIPAA privacy, security, and breach notification rules if a telehealth provider acted in good faith compliance with the guidance.

The Pre-Election Campaign Law (2012, amended 2021) lays down additional provision concerning campaign activities of parties, candidates and third parties [4]. The framework covers all political parties active in the national territory and running for national, local and European elections. The Law on Financing of Political Parties requires political parties to prepare and submit annual reports with information on their assets, liabilities, income and spending as well as declarations of income and expenses of electoral campaigns. The framework also mandates political parties to record and report information on financial contributions, in-kind and non-financial support, and disclose the identity of the donors. Corporate donations are banned. The Law on Pre-Election Campaigns provides clear definitions of campaigning activities, candidates and third parties. Pre-election incomes and expenses of candidates are considered as expenses of the party and accounted in the relevant election declarations. The Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (CPCB) is the public body in charge of the collection and publication of the data. The framework requires a verification process from the CPCB, which has to carry out audits on annual declarations within 4 months after submission and inspect declaration of electoral incomes and expenditures within one month after the election has taken place. In addition, the CPCB must examine the conformity of donations, gifts and membership fees within 45 days after they have been reported and carry out additional examinations in cases of irregularities. The framework mandates the CPCB to publish on its website annual reports and election statements no later than 10 days after their submission, and information on donations, gifts and membership fees no later than 7 days after they have been reported. Regulations No. 417 and No. 591 lay down provisions for the specific data points to be reported by political parties when submitting information on their finances. For membership fees, gifts and donations these include name of the donors and political parties, type and value of donations and date. As such, the framework supports the collection of structured data.",

The Challenge in Malawi is that there is no limit in terms of campaign spending, political parties can spend as they wish. During the 2019 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections evidence was all over as it was difficult to differentiate between a State Function and a Political Campaign Rally. A critical element of the campaign was the incumbent political party widespread and open distribution of cash and items. The presidential and Parliamentary Elections Act on the other hand under section 56 on campaign financing it is also silent in terms of open and transparent financing. As such the sour or manner in which political finances are sources remains a myth.

Turkmenistan's legal framework provides for private and public sources of financing for political parties. The framework prohibits donations from state authorities, charities, religious organizations, anonymous and foreign donations. The Law obliges political parties to prepare final financial reports on their incomes and expenditures and the owned property and liabilities, which must be presented to """"designated state bodies"""" only (1). The framework, however, does not require making this information available as structured open data. According to the latest available OSCE/ODIHR Election Assessment Report (March 2018), """"regulations on campaign finance are scarce and do not correspond to the reality of how the electoral campaigns are organized"""" (2). The existing regulation does not foresee limitations to campaign donations and expenditures, nor any reporting, disclosure, monitoring, or oversight mechanisms. According to the Electoral Code, campaigns and associated costs are directly managed and financed by the Central Electoral Committee, which organizes a uniform electoral campaign for all candidates. The Control and Audit group within the Central Electoral Committee is tasked with controlling the compliance with the established order of financing of election campaigns and imposing the liability on candidates in the event of violations.
